#INTRODUCING THE PIRATES OF TOKYO BAY STYLE GUIDE
Since our founding in 2010, the comedy scene in Tokyo (and across Asia) has matured and groups are increasing their level of professionalism both on stage and off stage through their branding and marketing. 

To carry us into the future, we’ve created a style guide. This guide will help us grow consistently and quickly without needing oversight for every pixel and will also help us focus more on shows and business training rather than bits and pieces like buttons and list items. It outlines:

- Logo, color and asset usage
- Voice, tone and style
- Show components and layout

It’s also a living reference tool for show producers, performers, developers, designers, marketers, and others, including our partners and media who want to write about our brand or use our assets.
 
#ABOUT PIRATES STYLE
With our brand, we aim to be simple but not simplistic, fun but not (too) funny.

Simplicity isn’t all that we strive for, however. Because we’re a comedy group that offers public and private shows as well as business workshops and training, we want for our brand and product to reflect the fun, energetic aspect of our service. We do this primarily through color, typography and form.

Pirates' colors are inspired by the festive parties of Mardi Gras, with shades of orange and gold with our supporting colors, dark purple, light purple and warm gray. Our brand’s font, Noto Sans, is a clean font with gentle lines and high legibility across media, digital and print.

Our vision is for everyone to laugh, regardless of their language. From building our brand to expanding our business offerings, this style guide allows for us to create with the same simplicity. We hope that it serves you well, too.

#LOGO USAGE
The Pirates logotype is custom-designed to embody many of the aspirational qualities of the brand. Highly efficient, the letterforms are based on traditional typefaces and subtly contrasted stroke weight. The "of Tokyo Bay" banner invokes the flags Pirates proudly flew.
